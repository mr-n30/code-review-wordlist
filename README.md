# Code Audit Wordlist
A wordlist containing potentially vulnerable functions to search for in your codebase

# Tips
- Use semgrep and graudit to help you find vulnerabilities. Both tools contain their own wordlists and are free to use. Some of the words in my wordlist are not found in those tools unless you purchase a subscription which is why I created [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-n30/code-review-wordlist/main/txt.txt) wordlist using my own research for [Bug Bounty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program).

- Take the PentesterLab code review badge. Very helpfull and worth the money. It contains tutorials and actual real world vulnerable code before it was fixed as challenges and tutorials in **various** programming languages. You earn a certificate at the end if you complete all code review challenges.
